# What is Wordle?
From Wikipedia:

> Wordle is an online word game developed by Josh Wardle, a programmer who had previously created the social experiments Place and The Button for Reddit. Every day, a five-letter word is chosen that players aim to guess within six tries. After each guess, the letters are either marked as green, yellow, or gray; green means that the letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means that the letter is in the answer but not in the right position, and gray means the letter is not in the answer at all. Conceptually and stylistically, the game is similar to the game show franchise Lingo. Each daily game uses a randomly selected word from a list of 2,500 words (out of the 12,000 five-letter words in the English language).
